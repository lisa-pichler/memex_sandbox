Stidte wie Haithabu (bei Schleswig) oder\nKaupang (bei Oslo) fungieren als Zwischenglieder, der arabische und byzan-\ntinische Wirtschaftskreis sind vor allem iiber Russland einbezogen. Die Han-\ndelswege fiihren zumeist die Kiisten entlang, mur an den giinstigsten Stellen\nauch tibers offene Meer. Die groflen Flisse dienen als Fernstraen: Diina,\nNewa und Dnjepr, Rhein, Rhone und Maas, Po und Loire; tiber die Donau\nhingegen erreicht der Verkehr Konstantinopel nicht. Dazu treten einige\nwenige Fernstrafen wie jene von Regensburg nach Kiew, die Brennerstrage\noder die Passstrafe durchs Aostatal. Von Spanien [duit tiber Nordafrika, Nil,\nRotes Meer zu Wasser und zu Land eine Route, die bis in den fernsten Orient\nfahrt.

Das geographische\nWissen. dieser Manner liegt weit tiber dem ihrer Zeitgenossen, vereinigt sich\naber nur z6gernd mit jenem lateimischer Kleriker und Ménche. Arabische\nHandler sind aufs Zweistromland fixiert, nicht auis Mittelmeer; doch begin-\nnen die Venezianer spatestens im 9.Jh. mit organisiertem Flottenbau und\nFahrten bis nach Alexandrien; im Jahre 828 entftihren sie von dort die\nReliquien des hl. Markus, der dann ihr Stadepatron wird.\n\nDer Fernhandel nimmt allgemein zu, auch wenn das nicht detailliert mit\nZahlen, sondern mur mit einzelnen Indizien zu belegen ist. Notker von\nSt. Gallen spottet um 870 tiber Héflinge, die sich in Pavia mit feinsten Seiden-\nstoffen eindecken, die ein Gewitterregen bereits zerschlei&t. Das Luxusbe-\ndiirtnis widersetzt sich gleichwohl erfolgreich monastisch-asketischer\nSchlichtheit; es f6rdert den Fernhandel und tiber ihn die frithe Kapitalbildung.\nJahr fiir Jahr besuchen Venezianer den vor Pavia, in einer Zeltstadt auf freiem\nFelde, abgehaltenen Markt; Rompilger wie der hi. Gerald von Aurillac sind\nihre Kunden. Das dlteste Handelsprivileg Venedigs fir das byzantinische\nReich datiert von 992; zur selben Zeit schlieBt der Doge Freundschaftsver-\ntrage mit muslimischen Fiirsten, wahrend die ,Pacta* der Stadt mit den\nlateinischen Kaisern, die ihr die Unabhangigkeit garantieren, bereits ins\n9. Jh. zurtickreichen (das alteste ist von 840). Im Norden tibernimmt Flandern\neine fihrende Rolle; bis nach Spanien reicht um die Jahrtausendwende bereits\nder Aktionsradius flandrischer Kaufleute. Der Hafen von London wird zur\nselben Zeit von Handlern aus Flandern, Ponthieu, der Normandie (Rouen),\naus der Francia, aus Huy, Liittich, Nivelles und von ,,Eigenleuten des Kai-\nsers® angelaufen. Auch der mitteleuropaische Raum partizipiert kraftig an der\nallgemeinen Entwicklung. Regensburg oder Verdun treten als Fernhandels-\norte hervor; Magdeburgs wirtschaftlicher Aufstieg beginnt. Mittelrheinische\nMiinzpragungen streuen im 9.Jh. tiber ganz Gallien. Zu Ottos d. Gr.

That figure, often cited in the literature (e.g.\nSorheim 2014: 114), is not reliable, since she has included a number of non-expertly\nrecovered and obviously mixed or uncertain grave finds in her calculation (see\nChristensen 1996: 6-8). Erik Jondell (1974: 34), analysing the same material, could\nnot observe any definite female graves containing balances.\n\n3 The best-preserved weights from Jamtland have been analysed by Joakim Schultzén\nat the Archacological Research Laboratory, Stockholm University, using CAD meth-\nodology to digitally reconstruct their original volumes and masses (for the method,\nsee Schultzén 2011).\n\n4 Another lost hoard consisting of Islamic coins has been reported from Hiillesjé in\neastern Jamtland (Hasselberg 1976: 11-12).

Further contours of fine webs of contacts towards sim-\nilar inland communities can also be discerned, for instance in the neighbouring\nFyresdal in Telemark County.\n\nThe development, coordination and at least temporary consolidation of\nthese routes was most likely dependent on local entrepreneurs functioning as\nkey intermediaries on a local scale, who seized the opportunity and potential\nwithin their area at a given time. The development of these routes should,\nhowever, not necessarily be seen as solely an effect of increased hinterland\nexploitation and growth in raw-material extraction. There is no direct causal\nlink between the sharp increase im the use of resources from uncultivated land\nand the development of transport routes and transshipment sites. The gradual\ndevelopment of more stable networks linking different regions may itself have\nacted as an incentive to further production and investment in outlying areas.\n\nReferences\n\n \n\nAmbrosiani, Bjorn 1995: Beads of glass and semi-precious stone.

            "result": "228 Jan Bill and Christian Lochsen Rodsrud\n\nresting at Gokstad, we may understand Heimdalsjordet as the terminal of a trade\nnetwork reaching out from Gokstad and designed to provide it with metals\nand other imports, at the same time as it housed the crattsmen who could\nconvert the imports into the weapons, jewellery and other items needed to\nmaintain Gokstad’s position. In such a scenario one could see Heimdalsjordet\nnot as a town or a nodal market in the sense described above, but perhaps as\na modernised central-place market, shaped to fulfil the needs of the elite at a\ntime when international trade was becoming increasingly important, also for\nthe uppermost strata in society. Such an interpretation will also contribute to\na discussion of the difference between an exchange site of South Scandinavian\norigin, as suggested for Kaupang, and a more locally based counterpart.\n\nAt present, any interpretation of Heimdalsjordet and the finds made there\nwill, of course, be extremely tentative and liable to be proven wrong in the\nlight of the more thorough analyses still to be carried out. Nevertheless, the\nprocess of formulating and discussing such preliminary ideas is of paramount\nimportance for future work, since it can help to identify research potentials\nand needs which may otherwise remain undetected. It also helps to identify\nwith more precision similarities and differences in the composition of finds\nfrom Heimdalsjordet and Kaupang. The current discussion has highlighted the\nimportance of comparing not only find frequencies, but also excavation meth-\nods and volumes. Also pivotal in iduminating Heimdalsjordet’s relationship to\nKaupang and the Gokstad burial will be attempts to trace evidence of connec-\ntions. A particularly promising perspective in this direction is the study of metal\nsupply and techniques used by the fine-metal craftsmen of the site, compared\nto those of Kaupang (Pedersen 2010) and those represented in the Gokstad\nburial equipment. Other core activities will be: to complete the analyses of\nthe numismatic and other datable find material, to complete the radiocarbon-\ndating programme for the site and to understand in more detail its chronology.\nThese steps will — hopefully — allow us in the future to understand more of\nwhat was happening when trade and handicrafts blossomed and Norway’s largest\nship burial was erected at a beach in Vestfold some 1,100 years ago.\n\n  \n\nReferences\n\nAmbrosiani, Bjérn and Bo G.

            "result": "246 Lofisgarden, Ramstad and Stylegar\n\nSo, what about Bjorkum? The establishment of the locality coincides with a\ntransitional period where the societies experienced profound structural changes.\nA good 200 years later, the end of the main phase coincides with a period when\nthe West-Norwegian societies were involved in new and complex networks\nwith the surrounding world, when raids and migrations westwards started and,\nsomewhat later, the first processes connected with the emergence of super-\nregional government and the formation ofa kingdom began.\n\nThe suggested parallels between Bjarkum and the assemblies known from\nlater tradition shed an interesting light on the site and seem to open up a\nbroader spectrum of interpretations than those founded on more abstract and\nformalised socio-political models. They bring forth some of the complexity\none faces when trying to characterise or define different forms of gathering\nplaces and corresponding multi-functional sites — places and situations where\nthere were not necessarily any strict divisions between ritual activities, alliance\nbuilding, feasting and consumption, production and trade, games and com-\npetitions, or entertainment and recreation.\n\nWhen we put all the pieces together, it is not hard to imagine that Byorkum\nmay have played a vital role in a social and economic landscape that not only\nincluded Leerdal and parts of Inner Sogn, but may also have had lines of commu-\nnication to the mountain regions and further eastwards. Hypothetically, one could\nenvisage Bjorkum as part of a larger network of similar places that were established\nduring the transitional period leading to the Viking Age. In a landscape with scat-\ntered settlements, like Sogn and inland areas in South Norway, such places may\nhave functioned as centres of communication or multi-functional meeting places:\nimportant institutions for maintaining and strengthening social relations.\n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\nReferences\n\nBergstol, Jostein and Gaute Reitan 2008: Samer pa Dovrefjell i vikingtiden: et bidrag til\ndebatten omkring samenes sorgrense i forhistorisk tid.

            "result": "From Vikings to kings\n\ncertain details of wording in the skaldic poems dealing with his battles.’° In\n961 he was defeated at Fitjar on the island of Stord in Hordaland by the sons of\nEirik, led by Harald grdfellr (Gray-fur’) and supported from Denmark. Hakon\ndied from his wounds when withdrawing from the battle.\n\nThe rule of Harald Grey-fur and his brothers only lasted for a period\nof between five and ten years. They killed Earl Sigurd, who had supported\nHakon, but in the long run this brought about their own downfall. Sigurd’s\nson Hakon succeeded in making a deal with King Harald Gormsson who\nturned against Eirik’s sons, most likely because they had been acting too in-\ndependently. A skaldic poem confirms that Hakon killed Harald Gray-fur in\na battle in Limfjord in northern Jylland. After that Hakon (c. 965/70-95) was\nin control of Vestlandet, Trondelag and Halogaland, initially as the earl of\nHarald Gormsson. In Viken it appears that subordinate petty kings ruled\nunder Harald’s overlordship.\n\nDanish supremacy had long traditions in this part of Scandinavia. We have\nalready seen (Chapters 5 and 8(b)) that in 813 Danish kings had gone to Vestfold,\na province that according to the Royal Frankish Annals was situated on the north-\nwestern border of the Danish kingdom. The ‘chieftains and people’ of Vestfold\nhad rebelled and were now forced back into obedience.” Later in the ninth\ncentury the Danish overlordship of Viken was apparently no longer effective.\nBut until the thirteenth century Danish kings from time to time made claims\nto be kings of Norway or at least of Viken. The early kingdom of Harald\nFinehair seems to have consisted primarily of Vestlandet; this was the case not\nonly during Harald’s own reign but also under Hakon and the sons of Eirik.\nIn Trendelag and further north the earls at Lade were mostly in control.\n\nOn account of his upbringing in England King Hakon was a Christian.\nWe have already seen that he tried to encourage Christianity in Norway but\nabandoned the project when it met with strong opposition (Chapter 8(c)). In\nthe coastal districts of Vestlandet the custom of furnishing graves with grave\ngoods gradually petered out, which suggests that Christianity was tolerated\neven earlier. But in Trendelag and some other inland regions the situation\nwas different. Earl Hakon, who succeeded Harald Gray-fur, was according to\nthe skalds a vigorous defender of the traditional religion. It was his resistance\nto Christian missionary activity that allegedly provoked the breach between\n\n \n\nhim and Harald Gormsson. The ensuing conflict ended with the defeat of\na Danish military expedition, led by the famous Jomsvikings, in the battle\n\n16 Holmsen, Nye studier, pp. 97-100.\n17 R.

            "result": "HN1I\n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nto draw attention to — is, through geographical and genealogical defini-\ntion, to demonstrate the ability of the Norwegian kingdom to control its\narea for missionary and ‘civilizing’ purposes. Such a statement makes more\nsense in the first decades after its inheriting the missionary mandate from\nLund.* It is not clearly made in Passto Olaui and in Theodoricus’s History\n(both after c. 1175), texts more focused on the sanctity of Olav Haraldsson.\nOn the other hand I think that HN presupposes the establishment of the\narchdiocese rather than the other way round. That brings us to the fol-\nowing result: HN must have been conceived in government circles, epis-\ncopal, royal, or both, in Norway in the second half of the twelfth century.\nwould furthermore favour a date in the third quarter, and this could per-\nhaps be narrowed down to ¢. 1160-1175, thus giving the author of HN a\nittle time to reflect on the ecclesiastical reorganization but not so much\nthat we should expect more recent impulses of foreign and Trondheim\nearning.\n\n3 Style and Narrative\n\nThe only investigation into HN’s language was done by Skard 1930.\nThough of course very dated in its knowledge of Medieval Latin, it is still\na useful collection of material with basically sound judgements. For more\nexamples and detailed analysis I refer the reader to Skard and to various\nlinguistic and stylistic points discussed in the commentary.\n\nAmong Skard’s findings the following deserve mention.\n\n~ HNis sich in vocabulary and the author set high goals for synonymic\nvariation and poetic expressions in his prose. A few examples will illu-\n\n \n\nstrate this. Synonyms for ‘tell’ are: astruere, affirmare, dicere, ferre, intimare,\nmemunisse, memorare, narrare; ‘famous’: celeber, inclitus, opinatus; preclarus;\n‘viking’: pirata, predo, tirannus.”\n\n~ The syntax is predominantly paratactic, even the longer periods. There\nis a predilection for adding new nexuses by accumulating present partici-\nples, gerunds in the ablative (functioning as present participles in the nomi-\nnative), and relative clauses rather than other subordinate clauses or abso-\nlute ablative. Ellipsis of esse is widespread, not only as an auxiliary verb.\n\n© The author's unique Latin naming in several instances can also be taken as an argument\nfor an early date, inasmuch as no Latin nomenclature had yet been established, e.g. Rodulfus\nfor Rollo (V1 10), Bergonia for Bergae (X1V 3), Solundicum Mare for Mare Occidentale (V 3),\nRoda for Rothomagus (V1 10), Sinus Orientalis for Wac.\n\n* For these and numerous other examples: Skard 1930, 49-52.\n\n24,\n\n \n\n24-25 - 31.10.02, 21:48\n\n \n\f"

            "result": " \n\nStyle AND NARRATIVE\n\n~ There seems to be no consistent prose rhythm, but rhyme and allit-\neration are two embellishments often put to use.\n\n~ Major inspirations for the style and phraseology are the Vulgate,\nespecially the Old Testament. Classical Roman authors are only present\nthrough poetic expressions they helped to make popular in twelfth-cen-\ntury schools (e.g. brumali frigere (I. 11), celsa stantem in puppi (XVII s0)),\nnot through quotations or obvious allusions (with two exceptions — see\nbelow). Apart from stressing the borrowings from Adam and Honorius,\nSkard does not single out any medieval model of style but hints that HN\nbelongs to one of the two international currents of the time, Theodoricus\nto the other (perhaps meaning what later has become known as mannerist\nversus classicist styles).\n\nA few examples will show some of the characteristics. First a brief\nperiod (IX 24): Sed paule post ipsum regem truculentus taurus confodiens tru-\ncidauit (Shortly afterwards however the monarch was gored and slaugh-\ntered by a ferocious bull”). Here as often elsewhere two acts are expressed\nby adding a present participle rather than an ablative absolute or another\nverb, juxtaposed or subordinated. The alliterative (here violent) sound of\nthe clause is typical of HN.\n\nA longer period can be exemplified by XVI 11: Factus adolescens pirati-\ncam excercens Battica littora perlustrando, cunctis gentilibus id locorum for-\nmidabilis existendo, inscius deuiatur a deo ille magnificus predo (“Grown\nto early manhood, he pursued viking expeditions right along the Baltic\ncoasts, a terror to all the heathens who inhabited those regions; yet this\nsplendid sea rover was unconsciously directing his steps away from God”).\nSuch periods may not be particularly long, but at times they come across\nas heavy, because of the author’s preference for participles and gerunds in\nthe ablative used in apposition or even, in some instances, in place of finite\nverbs. The choice of such an accumulative parataxis also makes for a rhym-\ning effect (adolescens ... excercens; perlustrando ... existendo). Alliteration is\naimed for again by choosing predo for ‘viking’ to connect with the sound\nof deuiatur a deo.\n\nAnother example with some subordination is XVI 15: Verum enimuero\ncuram gerens Conditor creature sue, hune tirannum tam remotum tamque\nindomitum per uiscera misericordie sue mirabiliter uisitauit, uisitando illumi-\n\n+ No investigation with modern methods has so far been carried out, but prose rhythm\ncertainly seems to be desired by the author, especially cursus planus and cursus tardus. This\nwould put him in the German tradition of which Adam is an exponent, of Janson 1975,\ns4~5s and Ekrem. 1998, 65. There is room for a thorough study in this area.\n\n4# Skard 1930, 85.\n\n \n\n24-25 - 31.10.02, 21:48\n\n \n\f"

Again there\nis a preference for participles and gerunds in the ablative, but the rhetori-\ncal crescendo is arrived at by the subordination and the additional effects\nof repetition and ellipsis (wésitauit, uisitando illuminauit) and the Biblical\nphrasing mingling no less than three scriptural passages (see commen-\ntary).\n\nA final example from a descriptive rather than a narrative part of the\ntext shows how the author achieves a demanding style mostly by way of\nremote vocabulary and exaggeratio (accumulation) (II 14~15): [bi equini\nceti monoculi iubis diffusis profunda pelagi sulcantes ferocissimi repertuntur.\nLllic pistrix, illic hafstrambus, maxima bellua, sed sine cauda et capite solum\nsusum et iusum dissiliendo ueluti truncus, non nisi nautarum pericula prefig-\nuret, apparet (“One-eyed, very ferocious walruses are to be found here, cut-\nting furrows through the ocean depths, with manes fanning out. There,\nalso, are the whale and the havstramb, a gigantic creature but without tail\nor head, which merely springs upwards and downwards like a tree-trunk,\nand only appears in order to predict perils for sailors”). The exotic vocabu-\nlary is highlighted by three recurring trademarks: ellipsis, rhyme, and allit-\neration.\n\nIn general the style of HN can be said to represent one of several ways\nin which eleventh- and especially twelfth-century historians strive to con-\nstruct a high-level discourse that goes beyond the mere biblical and Sallust-\nian imitation of ¢g Adam of Bremen. The twelfth-century Renaissance\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nand its increasing use of Roman authors in the schools has left its stamp on\nHAIN as well. In this case it has not led to a classicist imitation but rather to\none of various possible mannerisms which draws on biblical and patristic\nlanguage as well as on the fashion of inserting many poetic expressions in\nthe prose. On one scale HN places itself between the transparent and less\nambitious medievalizing style of Theodoricus and the heavy, hypotactic\nand classicizing one of Saxo Grammaticus. Among the mannerists, how-\never, HIN is less extreme in its parataxis and verbosity than Dudo of St.\nQuentin (¢. 1000) or the sometimes very recherché language of the Polish\nnational historian, Vincent Kadlubek (¢. 1200).

A fur-\nther emphasis on the close connection the author tries to make between Norway\nand the Orkneys lies in his use of the Latinized Norwegian term Pei (“the Pents”),\ninstead of the usual Latin Pictz “Picts”, “the painted ones”).\n\nFor their part the Papes, from whom the island Papey is named (mentioned as\nyet another piece of evidence that the author of HN is telling the truth) were of\nAfrican origin and were supporters of the Jewish religion, so here too, the Celts\nmust be left out of the picture. Where the author gets his version of the Papes\nfrom is unknown.\" Ari Frode uses the term “Papes” to describe Irish monks in\nIceland (ch. 1).\n\nBut then the Norwegians arrived in the Orkneys, even as early as Harald Har-\nfagre’s (Fairhair’s) time. This occasioned the total destruction of the natives (VI 8),\nat any rate in the Orkneys, and here the narrative broadens markedly in scope; the\nNorwegian vikings were descended from the Earl of More, conquered the islands\nand settled down, overcame the Irish, Scots and English and took part of their\nland; and one of them, Gange-Rolv (Rolf the Walker), conquered Normandy and\ngave it its name. It must have been around this time that the island cluster, accord-\ning to HN, changed its name from Pentland to the Orkneys. In other words the\nearl, Orkan, appears to be of Norwegian descent. [f this observation is valid, it\nmeans that not only the names Iceland, Greenland, “Sudroyene” (the Hebrides),\nthe Faeroes and Normandy are of Norwegian origin, but also the name “the Ork-\nney Islands”. This emphasizes their Norwegian identity.\n\nWe also note the use of the Latinized Norwegian name Roda (VI 10) for\nRouen, instead of the Latin Rothomum, Rodonum or Rotomagum, as well as the\nuse of the Norman nickname (VI 17) dongosped (“Long spear”, Norwegian: “Lang-\nspyd”) for the Latin longa spatha. This use might well derive from the sources,’\nbut it fits very well with the author’s purpose none the less.

Gange-Rolv also made inroads all the way into Friesland,\nwhere he died. We should note that the term ¢yranni (V1 13), used of him and his\nmen, means vikings, and in HN this could be a positive thing. Tt could hardly be\nused in that sense later in the century, when the civil wars had started, for by then\nthis word had acquired a bad odour. But most important of all, we understand\nthat Gange-Rolv's descendants took over the English throne. The last-mentioned\nof these is Henry 1 (i00~35). And what a king he would be, according to the\nEnglishmen’s own major prophet, Merlin, a /eo zusticie (“Lion of Justice”). Fur-\nthermore, in the Orkneys the populace to that very day were subject to élorum\nposteritatis dominio (“the lordship of their descendants”), yet (VI 21) sure ributario\nregibus Norwegie deseruiunt (“with the proviso that they are bound to pay tribute\nto the Norwegian kings”). Thus the connection with Norway remained intact.\nWe note the emphasis that the author puts on this; he repeats that the Orkneys\npaid taxes to Norway. This is one of the few places in HV where we find repeti-\ntion.\n\nIn addition, later in Book One the author has the great Christian king, Olav\n‘Tryggvason, being born in the Orkneys (XV 14), as opposed to another tradition,\nwhich says that he was born in Norway.'* The author's version, with which we are\nunfamiliar from any other source, strengthens the connection between the Ork-\nneys and Norway. Furthermore he credits this same Olav with having Christian-\nized everyone in Norway, along with everyone in the tributary lands, ze. (XVII\n31) Hatlendenses, Orchadenses, Fereyingenses ac Tilenses (“the people in Hetland (an\nolder Norwegian name for Shetland), the Orkneys, the Faeroes and Iceland”).\nHere it must be added that by terming the population of the Shetlands Hatlend-\nenses, the author probably indicates the connection with Norway again. The\nclaim for Olav’s Christianizing the Shetlands tells us that the author of HN knew\nthese islands well, and it is the first time we find what — on the surface — seems\nto be a slip on his part: having previously linked together the following island\nclusters, the Hebrides, the Shetlands and the Orkneys, stressing their unity, he\nnow splits off the Shetlands. Yet this is hardly done without reason; in fact it can\nbe explained by saying that this all took place in Olav Tryggvason’s time, not at\nthe time of writing, and that his source related it this way. We find this very same\nlist in Oddr’s Saga;'*° and, as mentioned above, they have a common source. Yet\nwe also find Greenland mentioned by Oddr, but the author of HN had already\ntold about its Christianization.

The Danes are perfidious and cowardly\nwarriors in HN’s story.\nIn connection with the naval battle we are told that Olav’s ship was called\n“Ormen den lange” (the Long Serpent”), and we are given a rather detailed\ndescription of it — not just because the author is impressed with its size, but\nperhaps because he is more interested in making the point that there were forty\npriests on Olav’s side.

The kings lineage\n\nThen, in the chapter about the lineage of the kings (point 2), the author of HN\nattempts, according to my interpretation, to show that even the constitutional\naspect of the question was valid, by means of a long series of independent kings,\nwhich was the true driving force in the Christianizing of the country. One king, St\nOlav, had already been declared a saint. Another, Olav Tryggvason, was worthy of\nit by virtue of his earthly life. At the time of writing, the Norwegian kings wielded\npower over a large area, from which they collected taxes. Furthermore, the author\nseems to show how desirable it was from a Norwegian standpoint for a separate\narchdiocese vis-’-vis Denmark, with a new diocese in the Uplands. The important\nrole that HN assigns to the Uplands would seem to indicate that HN was not\nmerely written out of a general need to put Norway on the map, as it were, for\nothers abroad; this kind of marketing of the Uplands has no purpose with respect\nto foreigners in general. The account, however, constitutes a strong argument to\nthe Pope for the establishment of a diocese. This emphasis on the Uplands, based\non my interpretation, suggests that HN was written before the establishment of\nthe Nidaros archdiocese and the Hamar bishopric; if HN had been an attempt to\nprovide an overview of the extent of the archdiocese after 1152/1153, then the Oslo\nand Stavanger dioceses should have been given as much attention as the Uplands.\nFurthermore, if HN was meant to constitute a mere chronicle of kings, the author\nwould probably have underlined the unity of the Norwegian kingdom in quite\nanother way; the keeping apart of the coastland and the Uplands, not only in\nthe geographical section, but almost throughout the whole book, certainly dimin-\nishes, more than heightens, the reputation of the Norwegian kings.\n\n9.3. A possible Book Il of HN?\n\nWhether my dating and interpretation of HN is accepted or not, it does not seem\nthat point 2 about the lineage of the kings could have been completed with the\nversion of HN that is available to us. Quite certainly the author of HN nowhere\nwrites that he intended to update the royal lineage to his own time (although he\noes sO anyway, albeit only briefly); but he writes in the Prologue that he has told\nabout meltorum magnificencias (“many men’s splendid feats”) in his time, record-\ning everything he has found worth mentioning. Of these we hear nothing. Moreo-\nver, the author of HN owes St Olav greater coverage. After all, it is as a beatified\nroyal that he lives on. But our copy gives us only Book 1, which concludes with\nhe viking king, St Olav’s, journey to Norway, ze. before his most important effort\nn behalf of Christian Norway began. The book ends, so to speak, with a kind of\nrelude to a potential Book I]. Confirming this claim is the heading of the first\nhapter after the Prologue: ficipit liber primus in ystoria Norwegie “Here begins\nhe first book of the History of Norway”). There was little reason to write this if\nhe work only included (or was intended only to include) a single book.\n\nBut more important still, provided it is true that AN was written in connec-\ntion with the establishment of the archdiocese, there is only weak support for this\narchdiocese having its seat in Nidaros. And who could be a better argument for\nthat than St Olav — but to be sure, only after he arrived in the fatherland and\n\nahavgsed\n\n \n\n211\n\n   \n\n210-211 30.10.02, 22:28\n\n \n\f"

We hear little about ‘Trendelag\nin HN; in fact, no connection whatsoever is drawn between this area of the coun-\ntry and St Olav. All this could mean that the Prologue was written before HN was\ncompleted. And if indeed HN finished at the end of Book I, this could be due\nto the author's (or his commissioner's) death. But according to my interpretation\nof HN, this could just as well be due to Breakspear’s sudden arrival. Such a pos-\nsibility must be considered, because after his departure there was no need for a\ncontinuation of HN, as I interpret it. The purpose was already achieved.\n\nOn the other hand, if we assume that the Prologue was written after HN was\ncompleted and if we take the wording literally, we would expect a Book II at the\nvery least; and it is reasonable to assume that such a book would have begun with\nOlav’s continued exploits in Norway and that an account of him would conclude\nwith his death and perhaps with a number of miracles. Further, it is reasonable to\nassume that this would occupy an entire book, or the better part of one. Such a\nbook, according to my theory, would automatically constitute the climax of the\nentire work; and it could well have had a different character. Since the subject\nis St Olav, we cannot al together discount the possibility that it could have been\ncomposed as a legend. However, it could also have been written by being based\non the same principles of historical writing as HN.\n\nIf we continue the train of thought from Book I, in a potential Book II we\nmight expect a parallel account with that of Olav Tryggvason in the vita-section,\napart from the viking enterprises abroad, i.e. some mention of $t Olav’s conver-\nsion and baptism. Furthermore, we would expect Olav’s Christian missionary\nwork in Norway to be given equal emphasis with Olav Tryggvason’s. As Olav\nTryggvason’s son, Tryggve, is not mentioned in Book I,*°? we might not expect St\nOlav’s son, Magnus, to be mentioned in a Book Il, though he actually became\nking after St Olav. The real climax surely must have been an account of Olav’s\ndeath, which took place in the Nidaros area itself, an important argument for an\narchdiocese there. As for good reasons there was no translatio of Olav Tryggvason,\nwe might not expect to find mention of St Olav’s. Finally, we cannot exclude the\npossibility that the book, which must have expressed a generalized pro-English,\nanti-Danish attitude, could have ended with a number of the miracles that we\nperhaps see reflected in the poem Gersfi from e. 1153 and in the oldest part of Passio\nOlaui (see below). At least one of these miracles might correspond to the informa-\ntion about Olav Tryggvason’s possible rescue by angels.\n\nIt is thought that the oldest Olav saga was penned during the years around\n1150.\"° Perhaps we could assume that a Latin version of this work, or of a cor-\nrespondingly early edition,\" was actually Book I of HN? If this were so, then it\nwould be easy to understand how it could have been separated from Book I and in\na short time have begun to circulate as an independent book, as an Olav legend.\n\n \n\n209 Cf Commentary on XVII 56.\n\n«0 For fragments of the oldest Olav saga and their nature, of de Vries 1967 LI, 241 and Louis-\nJensen 1970, 60.\n\n°° Cf, for instance, Schreiner 1926, 13ff.\n\n2i2\n\n    \n\n212-213 30.10.02, 22:28\n\n \n\f"

            "result": "THE EARLY AGES\n\nas there had been people in the land. We have noticed how life in the\nStone Age was intimately tied to the sea. A boat was at least as im-\nportant as a house, and traffic across the straits to the south, especially\nwith Jutland, brought new cultural impulses, When the far-flung\ntrade of the Bronze Age was broken off, local coastal traffic continued.\nDuring the Roman Period it became more extensive, reaching at least\nas far as to the mouth of the Rhine, but it was only in the fifth and sixth\ncenturies that Norway's own traffic over the seas attained large propor-\ntions. The general unrest of the age was a contributing factor. Many\nforeigners visited Norway and the grave finds indicate that they often\nbecame chieftains or at least men of wealth.\n\nBut the main reason that the foundations for Norway’s seafaring were\nlaid in this age is the iron axe, which made possible a marked advance\nin the building of boats, With the axe planks could be hewn, and gradu-\nally the more primitive types of boats went into disuse, as both the\nsmall boats and the larger vessels approached the type of the later viking\nships. A valuable find, the Kvalsund boat, probably from about 600,\nshows great advance in shipbuilding, both in the usefulness and the\nbeauty of the vessel. The Kvalsund boat is almost fifty feet long, is\nbuilt of narrow oak boards, and has a keel and rudder suggestive of\nthe viking ships. It has lines of real grace, its prow and stern rising\nboldly high above the surface of the water in strong, noble curves.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to know how much of the traffic was carried\non in Norwegian boats, the contact with other North Sea shores was\nso lively that the whole civilization of Norway’s southwestern coastal\nregions at this time has been called a North Sea culture. There was a\nconstant interchange both of goods and cultural impulses with Eng-\nland, Norway's chief export being fur. The even older intercourse\nwith the Frisians on the coast near the mouth of the Rhine also made\ngreat advances during this period.

The chroniclers, of\nwhom there were many, whether they used Latin or their native\ntongue, wrote with a rare poetic and imaginative sense. So, in contrast\nto the other Celtic lands, in Ireland every viking deed or misdeed was\nfully chronicled and lost nothing in the telling. But since individual\nincidents were recorded without any sense of continuity, modern\nhistorians have been confronted with a mass of confusing details.\n\nThe influence of Irish culture, and especially of the church, was felt\nfar and wide. Wherever Norwegians came in Celtic lands, and even in\nthe Anglo-Saxon, Irish missionaries had preceded them and established\ntheir church. So the Irish church, which was not absorbed by the\nRoman before the eleventh century, was the form of Christianity with\nwhich the vikings first came into contact. Even islands as far north as\nthe Faroes and Iceland had first been discovered by men from Erin,\nanimated both by love of travel and by religious enthusiasm for the\nhermit’s life in the wilderness.\n\nThere was a curious contrast between the high culture centered in\nthe monasteries and the primitive society in Ireland. The Irish had\nretained their early clan and tribal system with petty kings, and, al-\nthough they had a “high” king of Tara and possessed a certain amount\nof racial or national feeling, they had not attained any political unity.\nIn “noble Erin, the king’s isle, glorious scene of heroic deeds,” there\nraged bitter family feuds with bloody vengeance, wild wars between\npetty kings, and, most of all, sharp fights about herds and pastures,\n\n[ 46 1\n\f"

Bjarni sailed from Norway to Iceland to visit\nhis father, Herjulf, only to find that he had moved to Greenland.\nBjarni decided to follow him although, as he said to his men, it might\nbe rash, as none of them had ever been there. The ship was carried out\nof its course to the south and west, and when land was sighted Bjarni\nknew, both from its location and its appearance, that it was not Green-\nland, and therefore turned to the northeast. Twice again he saw land;\nbut in spite of demands from the crew that he go ashore, he continued\nhis course to Greenland and arrived at Herjulfsnes, just outside his\nfather’s home. The trip tested the courage and seamanship of the crew\nto the utmost; but the story is recorded with typical saga restraint and\nthe convincing accuracy of a ship’s log. From the description of the\nland and weather conditions it is almost certain that Bjarni skirted\nalong the coast from Labrador to Baffin’s Land.\n\nSoon after, Leif the Lucky, son of Hirik the Red, came to Greenland,\nsent by King Olaf Tryggvason to bring Greenland the gospel of\nChrist. Like his king, Leif was youthful, heroic, and daring, and withal\nkeen and able—one of the most striking personages of the age. He\nalready had to his credit one of the great achievements of that remark-\nable age. He had come to Greenland directly from Norway, without\nstopping in Iceland, and thus made the first deep-sea voyage over the\nAtlantic, with no effort to keep the usual course or stay near land.\n\nWhen he came to Greenland he met Bjarni and obtained from him\nall possible information about the land he had seen and the course he\nhad followed.

It seems\nreasonable to think that the Vgluspd was a great factor in perpetuating\nthe old.\n\n(| The Veluspd has come down to us from the Viking Age in a group\nof poems known as The Poetic Edda, or The Elder Edda, which were\nwritten down in Iceland during the great century of saga writing, about\n1150 to 1250, after having been preserved orally, some of them for two\ncenturies and more. Most of the poems were composed during the\nViking Age, probably in the tenth century, and are the finest expression\nwe have of the thought and life of the pre-Christian North. The names\nof the authors are not known, but they were from different parts of the\nfar-flung viking world, perhaps some of them much traveled, for in\nsome of the poems scholars detect traces of Irish influence—just how\nmuch they do not agree. One of them was composed in Greenland.\n\nThe poems are divided into two groups. The first is made up of lays\nof the gods. The most comprehensive and most sublime is the Veluspd,\nthe Sibyl’s Prophecy, in which the viva, or wise woman, rises at the call\nof Odin and reveals the secrets of the past and the future. The second\npoem, Hdvamédl, the Sayings of the High One, is a collection of wise\nsayings attributed to Odin. It reminds one of the Biblical Proverbs and\nis replete with shrewd wisdom, sometimes with a touch of satire, ex-\npressing a high standard of conduct rather than of morals. A third poem\nthat must be noted is the Rigsthuda. It has a mythological background,\nbut differs from all the others in being mainly a description of the origin\nof social classes, It was written in praise of royalty.\n\nThe second group in The Poetic Edda is composed of poems based on\nthe old heroic legends dating back to the Age of Migrations. Some of\nthe heroes in fact are identified with prominent leaders in the folk\nwanderings of the fifth century. Though the themes were not Nor-\nwegian, but foreign or common Germanic in their origin, the legends\nwere more fully preserved and more highly developed among the\nScandinavians than among other peoples; in modern times, of course,\n\n1 Olrik, Viking Civilization, 138.\n\n{ 67]\n\f"

Moreover, most of\nNorway's watriors were too busy in other lands to oppose Harald’s\nplans.\n\nThe somewhat confused story of the conquest can be summarized\nvery briefly. As Gorm, the Danish king, had just completed the unifica-\ntion of Denmark and was pressing his claim to Vestfold, Harald had\nto move northward to find an outlet for his ambitions. The saga tells\nthat after the death of Harald’s father, Halfdan the Swart, the Uplands\nwere in revolt and so the young king’s first task was to reconquer this\nregion. He then crossed the Dovre Mountain into Tréndelag. There\nHaakon, the jarl of the great Haalogaland family, met Harald with\nan army, but, it seems, the two came to an agreement without a serious\nconflict. Haakon was allowed to establish himself at Lade, near the\npresent city of Trondheim, and to control the eight shires of Trondelag\nin return for recognizing in some way the overlordship of Harald.\nSo the line of jarls who were to be the most serious rivals of the Yngling\nfamily and the chief obstacle to the unification of Norway, became\nmore strongly entrenched than before and came to be known as the\nJarls of Lade.\n\nAfter acquiring the necessary naval forces Harald proceeded to the\nconquest of the Westland, the subjection of which was to the interest\nof Jarl Haakon as well. First the coastal region directly south of Tr¢nd-\nelag was subdued and the mighty jarl, Ragnvald of Mgre, became the\nking’s ally and friend. Then Harald turned to the southwestern districts\nof Hordaland and the coast still farther south. This was the area of the\nmost violent viking activities, and vikings came even from the western\nsettlements to fight Harald. The struggle culminated in the Battle of\nHafrsfjord.

Olaf was now virtually sole ruler in the land, and\nas he sailed along the shore he was hailed as king in one zhing after\nanother until he reached the Eyrathing and was acclaimed there also.\n\nIn the next twelve years, during which Olaf reigned in peace, he\nestablished the first national government Norway had ever had. During\nhis first days in the Uplands he already showed keen insight into con-\nditions in the country and inaugurated the policy which he and the\nkings for a century after him were to follow consistently. As the op-\nportunity for winning wealth abroad was passing and the power of\nviking chiefs declining, influence and such wealth as there was~far\nless than at the height of viking activities—came from the ownership\nof land. Olaf depended for his chief support upon the leading odal\nfreeholders and their followers, and so allied himself with the new\nyeoman aristocracy. Among the yeomen he selected men whom he\nraised into prominence in opposition to the old chiefs, new men whose\npower rested upon their land and the favor of the king, not upon mil-\nitary prowess and viking adventure. Though this was not democracy,\nit satisfied the rank and file better than earlier conditions.\n\nThe people wanted peace and security. Olaf’s skald, Sigvat Thordar-\nson, as well as others praised Olaf because he punished great and small\nwith equal severity. The vikings, says Sigvat, often tried to buy safety\n“with gifts of red gold,” but “our chief had no compassion for the\nthief.” Regardless of rank, criminals were punished with death and\nroutilation, and thereby Olaf won the support of the people.

Most of the law continued to be local until\nthe late Middle Ages.

Olaf and the king of Sweden\nwere rivals for the possession of the district east of the Folden Fjord,\nbut after long and difficult negotiations in which Olaf used his faithful\nskald Sigvat as ambassador, the two made peace and Olaf married the\nSwedish princess Astrid. The king of Sweden was already at war with\nDenmark, and the two kings recognized, no doubt, that they had a\ncommon enemy in the strongest king in the North, Canute, who ruled\nboth England and Denmark and had ambitions to win an even larger\nNorth Sea empire. It was natural that Canute should try to reconquer\nthe land in which his father had exercised authority before the coming\nof Olaf. It may be partly because he recognized this danger and partly\nbecause there was still a good deal of the viking left in Olaf, that he\ntook the initiative both in forming an alliance with the Swedish king\nand in attacking Denmark. Canute could therefore say that his cam-\npaign against Norway was an expedition of vengeance.\n\nCanute made his plan well known in Norway and sent men and\nmoney to win support, promising the chieftains that he would give\nback to them the golden freedom of which Olaf had robbed them.\nMany of them had remained hostile to the new system and many more\nfell away, hoping to be on the side of the victor and to gain greater\nindependence under a king who dwelt across the sea. Even among the\ncommon people there were many who had resented the imperious way\nin which a new faith had been thrust upon them.

But\nit was a great advantage that a succession of strong and able men ruled\nNorway in this century.\n\nMagnus the Good (1035-1047), Snorri says, owed his throne next to\nGod to the loyal help of Queen Astrid, who called together a large\nthing in Sweden and obtained support for her stepson.

Thralldom gradually disappeared, as with the\nend of the viking raids there was no new influx of slaves, and the\nchurch took a stand against it. In the old Norwegian laws, slaves were\nthings, not human beings, an idea contrary to the Christian conception\nof the value of any human being, which slowly asserted itself in favor\nof emancipation.\n\nAnother development was the rise of cities.

In 1139,\nMagnus fell in battle and Sigurd Slembe was captured and tortured to\ndeath in a most cruel manner.\n\nThis ended the first phase of the civil wars. So far the fighting had\nbeen merely between rival claimants to the throne and their personal\nfollowers. The fighting forces were very small and there was no gen-\neral war.

To his support\nrallied the aristocracy, both lay and ecclesiastical, which was rising into\npower at this time. Ingi was tractable and gentle and, as the son of\nIngerid, Harald Gilchrist’s Swedish queen, he alone had the prestige\nof being a legitimate son, born in wedlock. When he was a baby, he\nwas carried through a battle by one of his faithful men, and received.\ninjuries which crippled him for life. He was therefore nicknamed\nHunchback. Even this disability served him in good stead. It caused\nhim to lean more heavily upon the strong men about him, and. his\nhelplessness seems to have roused in the ambitious thanes a loyalty and\nwarm affection which could rise above mere opportunism. This was\nespecially true of Gregorius Dagsson, a heroic figure, fearless, resolute,\nand able, who watched over the king with unswerving devotion. More\ncalculating and deliberate was Erling Wryneck. With Ragnvald, jarl of\nthe Orkneys, he had gone on a crusade that was far famed in the North.\n\n{ 130 J\n\f"

His party represented the interests of the freeholders in\nopposition to the thanes. As he was a minor the real leader was a\npowerful odal yeoman named Sigurd Hallvardsson who assumed the\ntitle of jarl, This term had lost its old meaning and was now for the first\ntime used to designate the one man next to the king in power and\ndignity.

Life centered upon the problem of providing sufficient\nfood for man and beast through the long winter.

The chief reason was the diversity of livelihood. If the food from\nflock and field was short, it could be eked out from the vast hunting\ngrounds of the highlands and the streams teeming with salmon.\n\nThere was little change in the daily living.

On the other hand he\nwanted to demonstrate “that the kingdom of Norway is not yet so old\nbut that there still remains some strength, wisdom, and vigor in it.”\nAnd with touching enthusiasm he praised the beauty, the humble\nresources, and the sturdy virtues of his country. Absaion’s work is the\nstrongest expression found in his age~of the urge for national self-\nassertion which was to be realized in 1814.\n\nThe man who did most to keep this national consciousness awake\nthrough the intervening centuries was Peder Claussgn Friis, the dean of\nLista. He was a vigorous, full-blooded man of wide interests and broad\nscholarship. In contrast to most of the humanists, he had scarcely\ntraveled outside his own district and never outside of his country. Yet\nhe had a wide acquaintance with all manner of people from viceroys\nto farmers, learning something from them all. He obtained a remark-\nable number of books and made the fullest possible use of them.\nThough he had the upper-class viewpoint in many ways, he understood\nthe people and had a certain respect for the doughty sons of the vikings,\neven when they balked at paying tithes. He was ardent and tireless in\nhis professional duties, and many of his writings deal with his pastoral\nexperiences, He worked in close harmony with his superior, Jorgen\nErickssgn, the bishop of Stavanger, whose sermons have been character-\nized as “unquestionably the most beautiful spiritual monuments of the\nReformation in our country.”™\n\nPeder Claussgn was constantly traveling about his district; he came\nto know it intimately and he put his knowledge on paper.

The horses\nknew the way, so one man could take care of from three to five sleighs.\nWhen such a train returned empty, it was a terror to all travelers. The\ndrivers shouted and yelled and the horses galloped wildly, turning in\nof their own accord at some tavern where their master was in the habit\nof stopping for whiskey. Not before the next century were the lumber\nworkers able to improve their conditions by acting as a group.\n\nThe vast majority of the people—probably nine-tenths—were still\nfarmers. As the new age brought no changes in agricultural methods,\nthe daily life on the farm went on much as of old, and in many ways\nthe country people clung to their traditional idea of self-sufficiency and\nsubsistence farming. Nevertheless, they became more and more in-\nvolved in money economy. The general rise of prices, which continued\nuntil about 1670, worked to the disadvantage of the farmers, but through\nconsistent efforts they held their own until better times came.\n\nThe most persistent and bitter struggle of the country people was\nagainst the trade monopoly of the cities. In Nordland the fishermen-\nfarmers became practically economic serfs of the Bergen merchants, as\nthey had to sell their fish and buy grain, and in Finmark conditions\nwere even worse. Although the rest of the country was much more\nprosperous, it also depended more on the importation of grain than\nin the past. Stock farming had increased at the expense of grain raising,\nso that only the East produced enough grain for its own use. Every one\nof the many regulations for the monopoly of trade by the cities was\nsecretly evaded or openly defied. It is interesting that the German mer-\nchants in Bergen often sided with the country people. When the govern-\nment decreed that grain should be imported from Denmark only, pro-\ntests came from town and country alike, as the supply of Danish grain\nwas inadequate and inferior. Every crop failure and famine in Norway\ncaused the bars to be let down for the time being. In spite of opposition\nthe cities attracted most of the trade, and burghers established stores\nand taverns in rural communities. Yet the country people were not ab-\nsolutely at the mercy of the burghers, for when the big markets were\nheld there was freedom of trade and all laws slept. Some old markets\nhad been discontinued or moved to a city, but others were held as from\npre-viking days at a crossroad or the head of a fjord. There people\ngathered from far and wide, from city and farm, coming by boat or\nsled, and there was selling and buying, fighting and drinking, frolic\nand fun. These markets served as a general clearinghouse for the in-\nternal trade.\n\n{ 309 ]\n\f"

Through the parsonages and other official residences the new in-\nfluence were gradually making themselves felt in the rural districts,\nand in the homes of the well-to-do farmers the old smoke-blackened\nwalls were beginning to give way to rich tapestry, bright painting, and\ncarving. In Christiania, where building regulations limited the use of\nwood, brick in warm tones of red and yellow in a style suggestive of\nChristian IV’s came into use in the seventeenth century. At this time\nchurch building, which had been almost at a standstill, was resumed,\nthe finest survivals being cruciform churches with a tall, slender spire.\nIn the midst of new trends, conservatism remained strong. The Han-\nseatic quarter of Bergen, for example, which was one of the historic\nsurvivals from a by-gone age—long before the German influx—was re-\nbuilt in the old Gothic style even after the fire of 1yo2, There was no\ndistinctive line between the creative artists and the skilled craftsmen,\nand, as in the humbler trades, the artists were associated in guilds with\nclose international connections, Many of them were of foreign birth,\nbut generally they became thoroughly acclimated in their adopted land\nand their work underwent a subtle change, adapting itself to the north-\nern traditions, tastes, and temperament. Often it is impossible to know\nwhether an artist is a native or a foreigner; and while Norway was\nenriched from abroad, the country also lost some talented men who\nwent to other lands never to return. Impulses from abroad reached\neven isolated mountain communities, but the people were not mere\nimitators. They made the new so thoroughly their own that, as a critic\nhas remarked, even the exotic acanthus leaf became as Norwegian as\nthough it had grown on a mountainside in Gudbrandsdal.\n\nThe age excelled in wood carving, which was used even more than\npainting to decorate the interior of the churches. Altar, pulpit, and\nfont were richly decorated. Before long the earlier Renaissance restraint\ngave way to restless rococo luxuriance. Scrolls, intertwining vines, and\nflowers in buoyant profusion surrounding figures of spirited angels and\nstrong apostles or whole biblical scenes produced a festive effect even\nthough a bit excessive and heavy. Almost as rich was the wood carving\nthat decorated the homes of burghers and officials. Much of the finest\nwork was done by foreign masters, but the Norwegians, who had ex-\ncelled in this art from pre-viking times, had not lost their old talent\nand skill.

Yet it is a grave\nerror to think that the romanticists blindly followed the dictates of\nemotions and ideals. There was a strong element of realism in their\nthought and work. Although the scholars of the day—historians,\narchaeologists, philologists, and scientists, even students of medicine—\nwere of the romantic school and accepted its fundamental tenets, they\nwere withal tireless seekers after truth and thorough, penetrating\nscholars who exerted a marked influence on many lines of thought of\ntheir age. Artists and poets, too, were in a sense realists. Welhaven, for\ninstance, believed that the best artistic work was based on personal ex-\nperience and on sound knowledge acquired through slow, painstaking\neffort. Thus even at its height, the national romantic movement, so to\nspeak, kept its feet on the ground. |\n\nIn the rediscovery of the past, so fundamental in romanticism,\nhistorical scholarship played a vital part. There had been some atten-\ntion paid to the history of the country even earlier. Wergeland had, in\naddition to shorter biographies and other articles, written an extensive\nhistory of the Constitutional Assembly, for, he thought, “No nation has\never experienced a more marvelous year than Norway in 1814.\"\" A more\nimportant book is Jacob Aall’s memoirs, a balanced, scholarly work\nremarkably free from prejudices. When a new edition was published in\n1859, the editor remarked that it was “still the only continuous presenta-\ntion which our literature possesses of the memorable events in the North\nin the years from 1800 to 1815.”\n\nThe historians of the romantic movement did not particularly con-\ncern themselves about that epoch, and in fact, their whole generation\nseems to have had little appreciation of the achievements of 1814. They\nturned to the time of vikings and sagas. In contrast to the opinion then\ncommonly held, especially in Denmark, that the North had of old been\none people with one language, they advanced the theory that Norway\nhad been settled by an immigration by way of the North, quite\ndistinct from Sweden and Denmark. This theory was valiantly defended\nby Peter Andreas Munch, although in his late years he began to doubt\nthat it was tenable, and it was, indeed, later repudiated.

A far more important departure from the older\nnaturalism was the desire to express the mood of a landscape, which\nwas a dominating passion of the neo-romantic painters. While it af-\nfected the older artists, it found its full expression only in the younger\nmen and women, of whom there were a great number. Only a few can\nbe mentioned, all masters of mood and color: Thorolf Holmboe pictured\nthe dreamy beauty of the fjords and skerries of the North; Nikolai\nAstrup painted the romantic nature about his home on the Westland,\nwith unsurpassed use of nuances of greens and blues; Christian Skreds-\nvig caught the spirit and even the weird atmospheric effects of the land-\nscapes about his home in Hallingdal; Harald Sohlberg’s most famous\npicture from Rondane Mountains, north in the Uplands, is a unique\nmarvel in hard, glittering blues and whites. Among other landscape\npainters who rank with these is Gerhard Munthe, but he won even\ngreater distinction for his contribution to historical art, which was also\nan important part of the neo-romantic movement. With the cooperation\nof other artists, especially Halfdan Egedius and Werenskiold, he\ncreated the classic illustrations for Snorri’s Heimskringla. By conven-\ntionalizing his themes he produced an art modern in technique yet\nclosely akin to that of viking and saga times. Later he employed the\nsame style in easel paintings and in mural decorations, notably of the\nHaakon’s Hall in Bergen.\n\nNo Norwegian artist has been so highly acclaimed or has roused such\nheated controversy as Edvard Munch, whom critics have pronounced\nthe greatest genius of all times among the country’s painters. He defies\nclassification. Although traces of every tendency and current in the\ndevelopment of painting from the \"eighties until far into the present\ncentury can be seen in his work, he was mastered by none of them.\nThere is soul-searching back of his paintings; and with uncanny power\nhe transferred to the canvas man’s most baffling problems and deepest\nemotions.
