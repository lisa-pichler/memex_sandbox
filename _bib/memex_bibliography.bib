It takes an intermediate position in the famous debate about Europe and the rest of the world and European dominance during the last few centuries. Morris uses all kinds of sources. However, his general approach is staunchly materialistic: the motors of history are fear, sloth and greed. Cultural differences do exist, but can be explained by the former factors. This is an attitude not confined to archaeologists, nor necessarily shared by all of them, but may nevertheless have something to do with Morris's background in this field. One objection is that Morris may have underestimated the importance of institutional factors; he does not discuss the division of Europe into separate states, which has often been regarded as a central factor in `the Rise of the West'. This in turn raises the question of the `two hand-maidens' and their relationship to the EU. If political division is an essential feature of Europe, what will happen if this division disappears?},

It is, however, often overlooked that both these works are chiefly concerned with warfare, and in them Snorri emerges as a significant military strategist just as much as he does as a political thinker. This is somewhat enigmatic, because according to contemporary sources that sketch out Snorri's life and career he had little or no personal experience of warfare, and a search of works in Latin that deal with the subject of war does not reveal that he borrowed many ideas from that quarter. Thus one is forced to conclude that he was a gifted and imaginative strategist by nature, although he did not put his skills into practice as a military leader. What is even more puzzling is that Snorri in the end put his life in great danger by disobeying King H\'akon of Norway, whose retainer he was, but failed to take any precautions against the king's predictable revenge, which a man of his military skills should have been able to foresee.},

In this study, the locations of Late Iron Age pagan Norse graves in West Norway and Iceland are analyzed and compared. The analysis also includes medieval church-sites in these regions, as well as in Norse Greenland. The approach is that of landscape archaeology, and two sets of analyses are used: an attribute analysis where the locations of pagan burials and medieval churches are situated relative to landscape attributes, and a distance analysis where the distances from graves and churches to the original farm cores are analyzed. The results show distinct differences in landscape organization between Norway and Iceland, both concerning pagan burials and church locations. No pagan Norse graves are yet known in Greenland, but the church locations are compared to Norway and Iceland. The church locations in Greenland have features in common with both Iceland and Norway. The political organization and church politics in the three countries are discussed, and the results of the analyses are tentatively associated with historic events.},

Although preliminary, the investigations indicate that in some parts of western Norway, among them Hardanger, the administrative structure differed from the general model described for the region. This finding implies a larger degree of heterogeneity in social and political organization within the medieval Norwegian kingdom than hitherto assumed.},

  abstract = {This article examines the depictions of royal luck in three sagas of \'Ol\'afr Tryggvason. In existing scholarship Old Norse concepts of luck defy clear definition, having been read variously as Christian and pagan; abstract and concrete; individual and societal; predetermined and serendipitous; innate and endowed from above. These apparent oppositions need not be mutually incompatible. Rather, the sagas discussed in this article approach these thematic concerns from multiple angles simultaneously. Since the texts are the products of an iterative tradition, notions of luck are shaped diachronically by layers of subjective ideology and idiosyncrasy, arising from multiple stages of authorial, editorial, and critical (re) interpretation.},

It was composed in Latin in the second half of the twelfth century, perhaps in the Oslo area. Only the beginning of the work exists today, but it offers, among other things, a detailed report of a shamanic s\'eance among the Sami as well as a unique early geographical description of Norway and the North Sea realm. Furthermore, we are presented with an early version of the Norwegian kings' genealogy, beginning with the mythical Yngling kings and ending, abruptly, with Olav Haraldsson's claim to the throne in 1015. This is the first critical edition of the Latin text since 1880, accompanied by a modern English translation by Peter Fisher. The introduction and full commentary in English take stock of previous scholarships and are new contributions to the interpretation of the text.},

The ambition with this survey is to support a discussion between the four approaches with a view to reach a more complete understanding of the relationship between politics and religion in all its complexity.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},
